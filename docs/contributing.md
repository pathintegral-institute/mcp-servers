# How to Contribute
Contributions to MCP Servers are welcome!  You can help with improving the existing servers, adding new servers, or anything that you think will make this project better.


If you are not familiar with GitHub and how to contribute to a open source repository, then it might be a bit of challenging, but it's still easy for you. We would recommend you to read these first:

- [How to make your first pull request on GitHub](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/)
- [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request?tool=webui)

In short, you can follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine
3. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
4. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
6. Open a Pull Request

Please make sure your PR adheres to:
- Clear commit messages
- Proper documentation updates
- Test coverage for new features

For creating new servers, please check [Build Your Own MCP Server](docs/build_your_own_mcp_server.md) for more details.
