## About
This repository contains a collection of open source [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) servers specifically designed for scientific research applications. These servers enable Al models (like Claude) to interact with scientific data, tools, and resources through a standardized protocol.

## What is MCP?
> MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.
> 
> MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:
>
> - A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
> - The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
> - Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure
